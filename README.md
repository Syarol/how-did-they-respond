24 February russia continued its 8-years military intervention in Ukraine and started the full-scale war. Most of the countries condemned russia's actions  ([UN resolution](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/3/unga-resolution-against-ukraine-invasion-full-text)) and imposed sanctions. Many companies declared their own statements on the current war with their actions on it. This repository is created for collecting them.
